# 🚗 Road Accident Dashboard

## Overview
The Road Accident Dashboard provides a detailed analysis of accident-related casualties across different vehicle types, locations, road conditions, and lighting environments. The goal is to identify high-risk areas and patterns that can support transportation safety improvements, policy planning, and awareness initiatives. The dashboard compares yearly trends and provides actionable insights to reduce accident severity and frequency.
